 ## User Stories

 The following **required** functionality is complete:

 * [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

 The following **optional** features are implemented:

 * [ ] UI animations
 * [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
 * [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
 * [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

 The following **additional** features are implemented:

 - [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

 ## Notes

One of the challenges I encountered was getting used to the syntax, it's more involved than just a backend coding language. I haven't had to do something that involves both the user interface and coding, as well as having those components interface with one another. I thought that was interesting, yet also difficult at the same time. I also felt like it was hard to get new pieces of the application implemented, because I don't have experience in Swift, but I think it was a good challenge for me to try and do something I hadn't done before.
